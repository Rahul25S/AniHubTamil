            Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most
            infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and
            execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change
            throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the
            existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was
            this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who
            dreamed of finding One Piece‚Äîwhich promises an unlimited amount of
            riches and fame‚Äîand quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the
            title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who
            defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular
            persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages
            for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder:
            the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing
            people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the
            footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across
            the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark
            mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the
            most coveted of all fortunes‚ÄîOne Piece. [Written by MAL Rewrite]
